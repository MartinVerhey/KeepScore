# KeepScore

KeepScore makes it possible to keep score among friends, students, schoolmates or colleagues.
It adds the possibility to play a bit more serious than just for fun. 
You can compare yourself against the others and have a proper ranking system going.

# Basic use

The main goal is to add scores for matches and get a leaderboard going.
We are using it for Table Fussbal, but it can be used for any game that is played 1v1, 1v2 or 2v2.

The system will calculate the amount of points you should earn, by comparing your strength (or the avg. of your team) against the strength of your competitor(s).

After that the ranking of each player gets updated. 
If you win, you go up. If you lose, you go down.

# Ranking

Each player starts at 1000 ranking.
The system uses the Elo ranking system commonly used in multiplayer games or chess but simplified.

It means, if your ranking is lower than the one of your opponent(s), you'll earn more points. And vice versa.
If your rank is higher, you can only earn a fraction of the points. 
That'll keep things fair.

In the end you'll have a beautiful leaderboard that shows everyone's rank.
It also shows, what will be fun matches to play. If someone's rank is close to yours, you'll be a close match-up.

Enjoy!
